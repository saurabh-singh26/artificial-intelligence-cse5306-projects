Let say the max player for game state is 1.
Initial score for both the player is 0.

The scores for quadruple have been defined as follows:
1000 & 2000: +1
1100 & 2200: +2
1110 & 2220: +3

The function searches for the above strings  in the game state in following order. Eg:
First search is for (1110, 2220)
Second search is for (1100, 2200)
Third search is for (1000, 2000)
If any search is successful, the player is assigned the score mentioned above and no further search is done for that particular player. All the 3 searches are done until both the players have been assigned some score.

Then the evalFunction returns the following score:
Score of player 1 - Score of player 2

Example 1: Eval Score = 3
Player 1: 3 (1110 is surely present; 1100 & 1000 may be present or may be not)
Player 2: 0 (No chance for player 2 to complete its quadruple)

Example 2: Eval Score = 2
Player 1: 3 (1110 is surely present; 1100 & 1000 may be or may be not)
Player 2: 1 (2000 is present atleast one time)
